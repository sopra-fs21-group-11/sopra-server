For my tests, I used two packages:

import SockJS from "sockjs-client";
import * as Stomp from "@stomp/stompjs";

Initializing the STOMP-Endpoint:
	var stompClient; //I defined this outside of any method. Similar to a class variable in Java. Absolutely no clue if this is state of the art :).

	const socket = new SockJS('http://localhost:8080/gs-guide-websocket');
	stompClient = Stomp.Stomp.over(socket);

Connect (do the handshake) with the server:
	stompClient.connect({}, function (someArgument /* I didnt use it*/){ ... }

Subscribing to a hardcoded (fixed) endpoint and do some stuff as a message from the server drops in: (Do this inside of the connect function brackets.)
	stompClient.subscribe('/test', function(something){
        	let anything = JSON.parse(something.body).content;

        	self.setState({something:anything});
      	})

To access "this" inside of the functions, I came up with the following line before the subscription:
	var self = this;

Subscribing to an user-specific endpoint (the game state thing). This is nothing else than a custom endpoint that consist of the url and the sessionId that every client gets:
Get the sessionid:
	var url = stompClient.ws._transport.url;
	url = url.replace("ws://localhost:8080/gs-guide-websocket/",  "");
	url = url.replace("/websocket", "");
	url = url.replace(/^[0-9]+\//, "");
	self.setState({sessionId:url});

Subscribe to endpoint: 
	stompClient.subscribe('secured/game/queue/specific-game-game'+self.state.sessionId', function(test){ //
        	alert(JSON.parse(test.body).content);
	      })

Send the "join game"-command -> registering for the information about the gamestate that gets sent during the game:
	stompClient.send("/app/game", {}, JSON.stringify({'name':name, 'id':"1", 'gameId':"1"}));

Disconnecting the session (cpt. obvious):
	stompClient.disconnect();
